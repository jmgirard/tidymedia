# tidymedia 0.0.0.9002 (development version)

## Batch processing

* Added `ffm_batch()`, the tidymedia batch entry point: it maps a
  pipeline-building function over every row of a jobs data frame (columns are
  passed to the function by name, `purrr::pmap()`-style), compiles one
  reproducible command per job, and optionally runs them. It returns the jobs
  as a tibble with an added `command` column and, when run, a `success` column.
  Set `parallel = TRUE` to map with `furrr` following the active `future` plan.

## Task verbs rebuilt on the builder

* Every task verb is now a thin wrapper over the Layer 1 `ffm_*` builder and no
  longer assembles its own FFmpeg command string. Each gains a `run` argument
  and returns its compiled, reproducible command (invisibly when run):
  `extract_audio()`, `audio_as_mp3()`, `crop_video()`, `format_for_web()`,
  `extract_frame()`, `separate_audio_video()`, `segment_video()`, and
  `concatenate_videos()`.
* `segment_video()` is now built on `ffm_batch()`: it returns the job tibble
  (one row per segment with its command and run status) and gains
  `reencode` and `parallel` arguments.
* **Cutting is frame-accurate by default.** `segment_video()` and the new
  `ffm_seek()` default to `reencode = TRUE`, which re-encodes so cuts land on
  the exact requested frames. `reencode = FALSE` selects a fast, lossless copy
  that snaps to the nearest keyframes (so the output duration may differ by up
  to one group-of-pictures). The previous copy-based `segment_video()` cut at
  the wrong point and shifted timestamps; that behavior is gone.
* Breaking: `extract_audio()`'s free-form `options` string is replaced by an
  `acodec` argument; `crop_video()` drops its `arg` argument and now centers
  the crop by default; `separate_audio_video()` returns a named vector of two
  commands; `segment_video()` returns a tibble.

## Pipeline engine

* Added `ffm_seek()`, a seek-based cut using `-ss`/`-to` (distinct from the
  `trim` filter of `ffm_trim()`), so cuts can stream-copy. Accurate seeks
  output-seek and re-encode; fast copy seeks input-seek and add
  `-avoid_negative_ts`.
* Added `ffm_concat()`, a blessed multi-input verb that concatenates the
  pipeline's inputs via FFmpeg's concat demuxer (fast, lossless, same-format).
* Added `ffm_output_options()`, a controlled passthrough for raw output options
  that `ffm_compile()` still positions and quotes.

## Pipeline engine

* Reworked the Layer 1 `ffm_*` builder onto a structured command model:
  `ffm_compile()` is now the single place that assembles, positions, and quotes
  every option. Single-input filter chains compile to `-vf`/`-af`; multi-input
  stacking compiles to a valid `-filter_complex` graph with explicit stream
  labels and an automatic `-map`.
* Fixed four builder bugs: `ffm_trim(setpts = FALSE)` no longer forces a
  `setpts` filter; `ffm_drop()` flags are now output options placed after the
  input (not before `-i`); `ffm_pixel_format()` no longer runs into the output
  filename; and the previously invalid `-filter_complex:v` output is gone.
* `ffm_compile()` now errors early when a stream is set to codec `copy` while a
  filter targets that same stream, instead of failing cryptically in ffmpeg.
* `ffm_hstack()` must be applied before other video filters and now produces a
  runnable command (verified end-to-end against ffmpeg).

## Infrastructure

* Added a testthat (3rd edition) test suite covering the `ffm_*` pipeline
  builder and `ffm_compile()` output, plus binary-gated tests for the
  ffmpeg/ffprobe/mediainfo task functions.
* Added GitHub Actions workflows for `R CMD check` (macOS, Windows, Linux) and
  test coverage; the Linux jobs install ffmpeg and mediainfo so execution
  tests run in CI.
* All input validation and user-facing messages now use rlang's `check_*`
  helpers and cli (`cli::cli_abort()` / `cli::cli_warn()`); the assertthat
  dependency has been removed. Added `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `purrr`, and `cli` to
  Imports (the first three were already used but undeclared).
* Enumerated arguments (e.g. `units`, `unit`, `section`, `template`,
  `program`) are now matched exactly via `rlang::arg_match()` instead of the
  partial matching of `match.arg()`; pass the full value.

## Bug fixes

* `mediainfo_parameter()` (and the helpers built on it: `get_duration()`,
  `get_framerate()`, `get_width()`, `get_height()`, `get_samplingrate()`) now
  shell-quote the `--Inform` argument, so they work on POSIX shells where the
  `;` was previously parsed as a command separator.

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
