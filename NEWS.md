# tidymedia 0.0.0.9001 (development version)

## Pipeline engine

* Reworked the Layer 1 `ffm_*` builder onto a structured command model:
  `ffm_compile()` is now the single place that assembles, positions, and quotes
  every option. Single-input filter chains compile to `-vf`/`-af`; multi-input
  stacking compiles to a valid `-filter_complex` graph with explicit stream
  labels and an automatic `-map`.
* Fixed four builder bugs: `ffm_trim(setpts = FALSE)` no longer forces a
  `setpts` filter; `ffm_drop()` flags are now output options placed after the
  input (not before `-i`); `ffm_pixel_format()` no longer runs into the output
  filename; and the previously invalid `-filter_complex:v` output is gone.
* `ffm_compile()` now errors early when a stream is set to codec `copy` while a
  filter targets that same stream, instead of failing cryptically in ffmpeg.
* `ffm_hstack()` must be applied before other video filters and now produces a
  runnable command (verified end-to-end against ffmpeg).

## Infrastructure

* Added a testthat (3rd edition) test suite covering the `ffm_*` pipeline
  builder and `ffm_compile()` output, plus binary-gated tests for the
  ffmpeg/ffprobe/mediainfo task functions.
* Added GitHub Actions workflows for `R CMD check` (macOS, Windows, Linux) and
  test coverage; the Linux jobs install ffmpeg and mediainfo so execution
  tests run in CI.
* All input validation and user-facing messages now use rlang's `check_*`
  helpers and cli (`cli::cli_abort()` / `cli::cli_warn()`); the assertthat
  dependency has been removed. Added `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `purrr`, and `cli` to
  Imports (the first three were already used but undeclared).
* Enumerated arguments (e.g. `units`, `unit`, `section`, `template`,
  `program`) are now matched exactly via `rlang::arg_match()` instead of the
  partial matching of `match.arg()`; pass the full value.

## Bug fixes

* `mediainfo_parameter()` (and the helpers built on it: `get_duration()`,
  `get_framerate()`, `get_width()`, `get_height()`, `get_samplingrate()`) now
  shell-quote the `--Inform` argument, so they work on POSIX shells where the
  `;` was previously parsed as a command separator.

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
