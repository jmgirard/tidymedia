# tidymedia

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle:
experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of tidymedia is to provide tools for easily working with media
(e.g., image, audio, and video) files within R and the tidyverse.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jmgirard/tidymedia")
```

### Dependencies

{tidymedia} uses [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) to
query information about media files. If you would like to use these
functions, you will need to install the command line interface (CLI)
version of this program. Links and instructions for doing so are
available [here](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo/Download). Below are
instructions for several popular platforms.

**Debian/Ubuntu**

1.  Enter this code into your terminal:<br />`sudo apt-get install
    mediainfo`

**Windows**

1.  Download the appropriate CLI .zip file from this
    [webpage](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo/Download/Windows)
2.  Extract (or copy) the contents of this .zip file to a folder on your
    computer such as:<br /> `C:/Program Files/MediaInfo`
3.  Run the following code in R (changing the path to match Step
    2):<br /> `tidymedia::set_mediainfo("C:/Program
    Files/MediaInfo/mediainfo.exe")`

**Mac**
