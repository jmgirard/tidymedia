# Design Decisions

Append-only log of cross-cutting decisions. One short entry each: what was
decided, why, and what it rules out. Milestone-local decisions stay in the
milestone file; promote them here only if they constrain future work.
Newest entries at the bottom. Never edit old entries; supersede them with a
new entry that references the old ID.

_D001–D009 predate the cairn migration (2026-07-11) and keep their original
IDs; existing citations across the codebase and CLAUDE.md stay valid. New
decisions continue at D010._

## D001 — Package scope (2026-07-10)

tidymedia is **reproducible media preprocessing for research/data-science
pipelines**, not "all of ffmpeg in R." Differentiators: batch processing over
many files, metadata as tibbles, reproducible compiled commands. Rules out:
chasing full ffmpeg option coverage, realtime/streaming use cases.

## D002 — Three-layer architecture (2026-07-10)

- **Layer 0 (escape hatch):** `ffmpeg()`, `ffprobe()`, `mediainfo()` raw CLI
  passthrough. This IS the "faithful wrapper" — no further faithful mapping
  will be built.
- **Layer 1 (engine):** the `ffm_*` pipe builder. All command assembly,
  quoting, option ordering, and copy-vs-re-encode logic lives here, once.
- **Layer 2 (front door):** task verbs (`extract_audio()`, `segment_video()`,
  …) implemented as thin wrappers over Layer 1. Most users only touch this.

Rules out: task functions that glue their own command strings (the current
`ffmpeg.R` functions must migrate onto the builder).

## D003 — The builder stays linear (2026-07-10)

Layer 1 models a **single input chain with sequential filters and one
output**, plus a small set of blessed multi-input verbs (stack, concat,
overlay) that manage their own stream labels internally. Full filtergraph
DAGs are out of scope forever; those users get the Layer 0 escape hatch.

## D004 — Tooling (2026-07-10)

usethis for scaffolding; testthat (3rd edition); cli/rlang for all
user-facing messages and errors (assertthat to be retired); GitHub Actions
for CI. Command *compilation* is tested purely (no binaries, CI-safe);
command *execution* tests are skipped when ffmpeg is unavailable.

## D005 — Development workflow (2026-07-10)

Milestone-driven development tracked in `project/`, orchestrated by Opus via
the `/milestone` skill. Subagents: Sonnet for well-specified parallel work,
Opus for design-sensitive work, never Haiku. Fable is consulted only through
the brief protocol (user-run clean session), never as a subagent.

## D006 — Filter emission: simple vs complex (2026-07-10, from M02)

`ffm_compile()` chooses the filter flag by input arity. Single-input
sequential chains compile to `-vf`/`-af`. Any blessed multi-input verb (hstack;
concat/overlay to come) sets the pipeline `complex` and compiles to
`-filter_complex` with explicit `[0:v][1:v]…` input labels and an automatic
`-map "[vout]"`; such verbs manage their own labels (D003) and must precede
other video filters. Rules out emitting the invalid `-filter_complex:v`, and
rules out `-filter_complex` for the single-input common case.

## D007 — Batch model (2026-07-10, from M03)

Batch processing is a single tibble-in/tibble-out runner, `ffm_batch(jobs, .f,
…)`: `.f` builds one `ffm` pipeline per row (job-table columns passed by name,
pmap-style); the runner compiles one reproducible command per job and returns
the jobs tibble plus `command` (and `success` when run). Scalar task verbs
stay scalar; fan-out task verbs (one input → many outputs, e.g.
`segment_video`, `separate_audio_video`) are Layer 2 wrappers that emit
multiple single-output pipelines. Rules out vectorizing individual verbs and
reaffirms D003 — the engine never grows a multi-output model.

## D008 — Cutting and seeking (2026-07-10, from M03)

Seeking (`ffm_seek()`, `-ss`/`-to` options) is distinct from the `trim`
*filter* (`ffm_trim()`), because only seeking can stream-copy. Cutting is
frame-accurate by default (`reencode = TRUE`: output-seek + re-encode). The
fast path (`reencode = FALSE`) input-seeks (`-ss` before `-i`) with
`-avoid_negative_ts make_zero` and is lossless but snaps cuts to keyframes, so
the output duration is approximate. Rules out the old output-seek-copy path,
which produced wrong-duration, timestamp-shifted output.

## D009 — Blessed multi-input set completed, video-only (2026-07-10, from M07)

The D003 blessed set is now `hstack`, `vstack`, `overlay`, `concat` — all
**single video output** verbs riding the existing `-filter_complex … [vout]`
path (D006). `xstack` (grid) and `amix` (audio mix) stay Layer 0: `amix`
specifically is deferred because an audio output would require generalizing the
`[vout]`-only complex-compile path to an `[aout]` output — a distinct future
milestone, not a bolt-on. Audio in stacked/overlaid output stays
explicit-map-only (D-M06-1); Layer-2 verbs (`compare_videos`,
`picture_in_picture`) expose an `audio =` index that resolves to `ffm_map()`.
Filtergraph assembly (including `ffm_overlay(scale=)`'s scale2ref inset) stays
in Layer 1 (D002); Layer-2 verbs only compute arguments. Rules out per-verb
hand-glued filtergraphs at Layer 2 and any multi-/audio-output engine model
for now.

## D010 — Tracking moved to cairn (2026-07-11)

Project tracking migrated from the bespoke `project/` layout to the **cairn**
plugin, adopt-in-place: `project/` content moved into canonical `cairn/` files
(ROADMAP regrouped by status; DESIGN.md added; live/done milestones relocated),
the repo-local `.claude/skills/milestone` skill retired to `cairn/legacy/`, and
the eight cairn skills (`/milestone*`, `/hotfix`, `/cairn-release`,
`/cairn-init`) are now the sanctioned way to change project state. Supersedes
D005's `project/`-path reference (the milestone-driven workflow itself stands);
architecture rationale now lives in `cairn/DESIGN.md`.

## D011 — Verification & provenance layer outside the engine (2026-07-11, from M08)

Output verification and batch provenance are a layer *over* the engine, never a
change to the `ffm` object (D003). `verify_media()` is a standalone probe-backed
primitive wired into execution via `ffm_run(verify=)` (aborts on failure, like
its FFmpeg-exit abort) and `ffm_batch(verify=)` (records a `verified` column,
never aborts) — there is no `ffm_expect()` verb, so the pipeline object stays
command-only. The batch provenance manifest (`ffm_manifest()` /
`ffm_batch(manifest=, checksums=)`) is opt-in and attached as an attribute; md5
checksums opt-in; CSV output only (no JSON/hash dependency). Rules out an
assertion-carrying engine object and any always-on provenance overhead.

## D012 — `future` declared in Suggests (2026-07-12, from hotfix)

`future` is now an explicit `Suggests` dependency. The parallel batch path
(`ffm_batch(parallel = TRUE)`) already relied on it transitively via `furrr`;
the sequential-plan guard added in this hotfix references `future::plan()`
directly, so the dependency is declared to satisfy `R CMD check`'s undeclared-
`::` check. No new install footprint (`furrr`, itself in `Suggests`, imports
`future`). Rules out reaching into `future` internals; only `plan()` is used.

## D013 — Analyze-then-build execution pattern (2026-07-12, from M16)

`normalize_audio(two_pass = TRUE)` is tidymedia's first verb that must **run a
binary to build a later command**: an analysis pass
(`loudnorm=…:print_format=json -f null -`) is executed, its stderr parsed (a
small regex, no JSON dependency — D011 spirit), and the measured values drive a
linear correction pass built on the shared `normalize_audio_pipeline()`. The
orchestrator lives beside `ffm_run()`; `ffm_compile()` stays pure (D002). New
consequence: `run = FALSE` **no longer guarantees a binary-free call** — under
`two_pass = TRUE` the analysis pass always runs (it needs the binary and a
readable input) and `run` gates only the correction pass. Single-pass behavior
is byte-for-byte unchanged and stays binary-free under `run = FALSE`. Rules out
folding analysis into `ffm_compile()` and rules out a two-pass path that skips
the binary under `run = FALSE`.

## D014 — API naming scheme + clean-break rename policy (2026-07-12, from M22)

Canonical naming conventions for the public surface, from the M22 audit
(`cairn/references/naming-docs-audit-M22.md §5–6`), to be applied by the M22
execution follow-up:

- **Task verbs** are `verb_object`; no verb hard-codes a fixed format/codec in
  its name (retires `audio_as_mp3`).
- **`ffm_*`** marks Layer-1 engine surface only; nothing outside Layer 1 uses it
  (references IP1's three-layer separation; does not change IP1).
- **`get_*` is reserved for per-file metadata scalars.** ffmpeg **capability**
  queries are not `get_*` (retires the `get_codecs`/`get_encoders` overload).
- **Metadata prefixes carry backend meaning:** `probe_*` = ffprobe→tibble,
  `mediainfo_*` = MediaInfo→tibble/value, file-metadata scalars a distinct
  getter prefix; the boundary is documented, not merged.
- **Batch siblings use a `<scalar_verb>_batch` suffix**, not a plural noun:
  `segment_video_batch`, `standardize_video_batch`, `normalize_audio_batch`,
  `anonymize_video_batch`, `extract_frame_batch` (retires `*_videos`/`_audios`;
  also disambiguates the old `extract_frames`).
- **Argument vocabulary:** `infile`/`outfile`/`infiles` for transforms, `file`
  for read-only metadata; full-word compound args (`audio_codec`, `video_codec`,
  `pixel_format`, `sample_rate`) — retires `acodec`/`vcodec`; time bounds
  `start`/`end` (+ `duration`, `timestamp` where distinct) — retires
  `ts_start`/`ts_stop`; `run`/`reencode`/`parallel` keep current spellings.
- **Reexports:** drop the unused tidy-eval quoting helpers
  (`enquo`/`enquos`/`as_label`/`as_name`, and `:=` unless a documented pattern
  needs it); **keep `.data`** (used internally in `filter_streams()`).
- **Rename policy: clean break** — no `lifecycle` shims; the API is pre-0.2.0
  and still soaking (D001). Old names are removed, not deprecated.

Rules out silent per-verb naming drift and `lifecycle`-shim compatibility for
this cleanup. The renames themselves are an irreversible-API change carried by
the execution follow-up, not by M22 (which is audit-only).
