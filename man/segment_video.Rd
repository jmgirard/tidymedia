\usage{
segment_video(infile, ts_start, ts_stop, outdir = NULL, padding = 3, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{infile}{A string containing the path to a video file.}

\item{ts_start}{A vector containing one or more timestamps indicating the
start of each segment to create. Can be either a numeric vector indicating
seconds or a character vector with time duration syntax. Must have the same
length as \code{ts_stop}.}

\item{ts_stop}{A vector containing one or more timestamps indicating the stop
of each segment to create. Can be either a numeric vector indicating
seconds or a character vector with time duration syntax. Must have the same
length as \code{ts_start}.}

\item{outdir}{A string containing the path to an existing directory in which
to create the segmented video files.}

\item{padding}{The number of digits to zero-pad the segment filename to. For
example, if \code{infile} was "x.mp4", then setting this to 3 would result
in the first segment file being named "x_001.mp4" and setting this to 2
would result in the first segment file being named "x_01.mp4".}
}
\description{
Use FFmpeg to quickly break a single video file into multiple smaller video
files (with the same encoding) based on pairs of start and stop timestamps.
Segment video files will be named by taking the name of \code{infile} and
appending a suffix of an underscore (_) and an integer indicating which
segment (based on the order provided in \code{ts_start} and \code{ts_stop}).
