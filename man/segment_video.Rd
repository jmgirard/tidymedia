\usage{
segment_video(infile, ts_start, ts_stop, outdir = NULL, outnames = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{infile}{A string containing the path to a video file.}

\item{ts_start}{A vector containing one or more timestamps indicating the
start of each segment to create. Can be either a numeric vector indicating
seconds or a character vector with time duration syntax. Must have the same
length as \code{ts_stop}.}

\item{ts_stop}{A vector containing one or more timestamps indicating the stop
of each segment to create. Can be either a numeric vector indicating
seconds or a character vector with time duration syntax. Must have the same
length as \code{ts_start}.}

\item{outdir}{Either NULL or a string containing the path to an existing
directory in which to create the segmented video files. If NULL, the
segmented video files are created in the same directory as \code{infile}.}

\item{outnames}{Either NULL or a character vector indicating the filename
(with extension) for each segment to create. If NULL, will append a
zero-padded integer to \code{infile}. If not NULL, must have the same
length as \code{ts_start}.}

\item{...}{Not currently used}
}
\description{
Use FFmpeg to quickly break a single video file into multiple smaller video
files (with the same encoding) based on pairs of start and stop timestamps.
Segment video files will be named by taking the name of \code{infile} and
appending a suffix of an underscore (_) and an integer indicating which
segment (based on the order provided in \code{ts_start} and \code{ts_stop}).
