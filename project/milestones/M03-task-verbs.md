# M03: Task verbs rebuilt on the builder + batch support

- **Status:** planned <!-- mirror of ROADMAP.md; ROADMAP wins on conflict -->
- **Created:** 2026-07-10
- **Completed:** —

## Goal

Make Layer 2 real: every task verb becomes a thin wrapper over the Layer 1
`ffm_*` builder (D002) instead of gluing its own command string, and add the
D001 headline feature — batch processing over many files. Delivers the
package's reason to exist: reproducible, inspectable compiled commands run
tidily across a whole folder of media.

## Scope

**In:**

- Small, reused engine primitives that unblock the migration:
  - `ffm_concat()` — blessed concat-demuxer verb (D006 anticipated it).
  - Copy-safe **seek** (`-ss`/`-to` as options, distinct from the trim
    *filter*) so trims/segments can stream-copy without re-encoding.
  - Controlled output-options passthrough so a verb can add specific flags
    (e.g. `extract_frame` quality flags) while `ffm_compile()` still owns
    positioning/quoting — not full-command gluing.
- `ffm_batch(jobs, .f, ..., run, parallel)`: tibble-in/tibble-out runner;
  `.f` builds an ffm pipeline per row; returns the original columns plus the
  compiled `command` and (when run) a status column; opt-in `furrr`
  parallelism; dry-run returns commands without executing.
- Migrate single-output verbs onto the builder with a consistent `run`
  (dry-run) arg returning the compiled command: `extract_audio`,
  `audio_as_mp3`, `crop_video`, `format_for_web`, `extract_frame`.
- Rebuild fan-out verbs as batch/multi-pipeline wrappers (single-output per
  job, D003 intact): `segment_video` (jobs tibble -> `ffm_batch` + seek/copy),
  `separate_audio_video` (two single-output pipelines).
- Rebuild `concatenate_videos()` on `ffm_concat()`.

**Out:**

- overlay / vstack and any other new engine verbs — later milestone.
- `get_volume()` and all audio-analysis / metadata work — M04.
- `get_codecs()` / `get_encoders()` introspection — stay Layer 0 helpers,
  unchanged.
- Multi-output *engine* model — D003 stands; fan-out lives in Layer 2.
- New user-facing filters beyond those above.

## Acceptance criteria

Each verifiable with evidence at review time.

- [ ] No task verb in `R/ffmpeg.R` assembles an ffmpeg command by string glue:
      each delegates to the builder / `ffm_compile()` (grep shows no `glue(...`
      command assembly in the migrated verbs; review confirms).
- [ ] `ffm_concat()` and seek/passthrough primitives compile to correct
      commands — pure snapshot tests (CI-safe, no binaries).
- [ ] `ffm_batch()` maps a pipeline over a jobs tibble and returns a tibble
      with `command` (+ status when run); dry-run returns commands without
      executing — covered by CI-safe tests.
- [ ] `segment_video`, `separate_audio_video`, `concatenate_videos` produce
      runnable commands — compile snapshots + binary-gated E2E.
- [ ] `devtools::test()` clean; `devtools::check()` 0 errors / 0 warnings /
      0 notes; CI green on all platforms.
- [ ] `NEWS.md` updated under the development version.

## Plan

Tasks sized to one working session or less, ordered by dependency.

- [ ] T1: Engine — controlled output-options passthrough slot + `ffm_compile()`
      positioning + tests.
- [ ] T2: Engine — copy-safe seek (`-ss`/`-to` options) + tests.
- [ ] T3: Engine — `ffm_concat()` (concat demuxer) + compile support + tests.
- [ ] T4: `ffm_batch()` runner (tibble in/out, `furrr` opt-in, dry-run) + tests.
- [ ] T5: Migrate single-output verbs (`extract_audio`, `audio_as_mp3`,
      `crop_video`, `format_for_web`, `extract_frame`) with consistent `run`
      + tests.
- [ ] T6: Rebuild fan-out/concat verbs (`segment_video` via batch+seek,
      `separate_audio_video` as two pipelines, `concatenate_videos` via
      `ffm_concat`) + binary-gated E2E.
- [ ] T7: `devtools::document()`, `NEWS.md`, README check, final
      `devtools::check()`.

## Work log

Append-only; newest last. One line per session: date, what happened, next.

- 2026-07-10: Milestone planned (batch = tibble runner; segment_video via
  batch+seek; ffm_concat added; breaking changes allowed).

## Decisions

Milestone-local decisions; promote cross-cutting ones to ../DECISIONS.md.

- D-M03-1: Batch is a tibble-in/tibble-out runner (`ffm_batch`), not verb
  vectorization; scalar verbs stay scalar (user pick).
- D-M03-2: Fan-out (segment/separate) is a Layer 2 concern implemented via
  multiple single-output pipelines; the engine stays single-output (D003).
- D-M03-3: Seek (`-ss`/`-to` options) is separate from the trim *filter* so
  copy-based cuts avoid the D-M02-5 copy+filter guard (no forced re-encode).
