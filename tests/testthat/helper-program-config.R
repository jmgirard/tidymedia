# Shared fixtures for the program-management family: a stub executable, the two
# redirected config directories, and the published program vocabulary. They
# live in a helper rather than in test-program-management.R because the M113
# tests of program_status() and unset_program() need the same three, and a test
# file's definitions are not visible to another test file.

# An executable `Sys.which()` resolves under an EMPTY `PATH`, which is what
# set_program() demands of a location and what find_program() re-checks after
# reading one back. An absolute path resolves without a search, so the suite's
# own PATH never enters the evidence. On Windows `Sys.which()` needs an
# executable extension; `.bat` is the one that needs no compiler.

# empties it makes all three states below return NULL. An absolute path to an
# executable still resolves under PATH = "" (measured at T4).

# R_USER_CONFIG_DIR redirects tools::R_user_dir(); the legacy library is
# redirected by a mock of rappdirs::user_config_dir() that answers from a
# `legacy/` subtree of the same temporary root. One envvar cannot redirect
# both: rappdirs honors
# R_USER_CONFIG_DIR too, and on Windows the two libraries then collapse onto
# the same `<root>/R/tidymedia` (measured on the windows-latest CI leg at
# M097's review), which made the both-present state assert nothing and the
# third state delete the only file.
